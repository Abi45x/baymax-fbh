# Fredboat Hangout Baymax Model

Taking up on the [Baymax bot](https://github.com/napstr/Baymax) proposal from Napstr, this is the repository that will hold the model for FredBoat Hangout. The initial config will be done by me, if there are any objections, or suggestions, read below.

# General Guide/Vars
Since the template that can be found on the repo above is self explanatory and logical, this one should follow the same structure.

In case you need any extra guidance, ping me on Discord, or submit a PR right away.
